# Plan 01-01 Summary: Multi-Image Session Foundation

## What was built

Refactored the monolithic `Upscale.tsx` into a modular workspace architecture with multi-image session support, mode switching, and an AI Studio step shell.

## Files created/modified

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `hooks/useUpscale.ts` | Created | Feature-local orchestration hook (196 lines) |
| `types.ts` | Modified | Added `UpscaleMode`, `UpscaleStudioStep`, `UpscaleSessionImage` |
| `components/Upscale.tsx` | Rewritten | Thin coordinator wiring hook → child components (115 lines) |
| `components/upscale/UpscaleModeSwitch.tsx` | Created | Segmented Quick/Studio toggle (49 lines) |
| `components/upscale/UpscaleSessionImageRail.tsx` | Created | Thumbnail rail with active highlight + badges (108 lines) |
| `components/upscale/UpscaleQuickPanel.tsx` | Created | Quality selector + upscale button (106 lines) |
| `components/upscale/UpscaleStudioStepShell.tsx` | Created | Analyze → Enhance → Export step header (97 lines) |
| `components/upscale/UpscaleOutputPanel.tsx` | Created | Shared before/after output panel (81 lines) |
| `locales/en.ts` | Modified | Added 14 new upscale keys |
| `locales/vi.ts` | Modified | Added 14 new upscale keys (Vietnamese) |
| `__tests__/hooks/useUpscale.test.tsx` | Created | 21 regression tests for hook contract |
| `__tests__/components/Upscale.test.tsx` | Created | 8 integration tests for workspace UI |

## Requirements covered

- **UPS-01**: Multi-image session — users keep multiple uploaded images available, newest auto-activates
- **UPS-03**: Active-image switching — selecting a different image drives the workspace without losing per-image state
- **UPS-04**: Mode coexistence — Quick Upscale and AI Studio modes switch without resetting drafts
- **UPS-05**: AI Studio step shell — visible step header (Analyze → Enhance → Export) with disabled future steps

## Verification results

- [x] `npm run test -- useUpscale` → **21 passed**
- [x] `npm run test -- Upscale` → **29 passed** (21 hook + 8 component)
- [x] `npm run test` → **443 passed** across 19 files (no regressions)
- [x] `npm run build` → success, no errors

## Architecture decisions

1. **Feature-local state only** — no new global store/context. All session state lives in `useUpscale`.
2. **Stable IDs via `crypto.randomUUID()`** — avoids index-based identity for safe reordering/removal.
3. **Per-image state isolation** — each `UpscaleSessionImage` carries its own quality, result, and studio step.
4. **Phase 1 step shell is a placeholder** — shows step navigation UI but content area awaits Phase 2+ implementation.
5. **Provider/model resolution in hook** — UI components never touch API config directly.
