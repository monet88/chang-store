## 2025-02-14 - Optimize Base64 Padding Calculation O(N) to O(1)
**Learning:** Checking for padding (`=`) at the end of large base64 strings (like image payloads) using `.match(/=/g)` is highly inefficient. It forces JavaScript to scan the *entire* string (which can be several megabytes), effectively making an O(1) operation O(N) and blocking the main thread for ~10ms+ per image.
**Action:** Always use string ending checks like `.endsWith('==')` and `.endsWith('=')` when dealing with base64 padding, as it executes in O(1) time and completes in microseconds regardless of payload size.

## 2025-02-14 - Optimize Image Compression O(N) to O(1) Main Thread Blocking
**Learning:** Using `canvas.toDataURL` for image compression/resizing is synchronous and blocks the main thread, causing severe UI jank when processing large images.
**Action:** Always use `canvas.toBlob` combined with an asynchronous FileReader (`blobToBase64`) when performing canvas operations on large images, as it delegates the encoding process to a background thread.
